Integration Testing is a level of software testing where individual units or modules of a software are combined and tested as a group. The goal is to identify issues in how these modules interact with each other.

✅ Why is Integration Testing Important?
Even if modules work perfectly in isolation (after unit testing), they might fail when connected, due to:

Interface mismatches

Incorrect data flow

Wrong API calls

Timing issues or shared memory bugs

🧩 Types of Integration Testing Approaches
1. Big Bang Integration
All modules are combined and tested together.

✅ Simple to implement.

❌ Hard to debug, as it’s difficult to pinpoint the issue source.

2. Top-Down Integration
Start testing from the top-level modules and integrate lower-level modules step-by-step.

Uses stubs (dummy modules) for lower modules if they are not ready.

✅ Early prototype can be seen.

❌ Lower-level bugs may be caught late.

3. Bottom-Up Integration
Begin with lower-level modules and integrate upward.

Uses drivers (dummy modules) to simulate higher modules.

✅ Better for testing foundational components early.

❌ User interface is tested late.

4. Sandwich (Hybrid) Integration
Combines top-down and bottom-up approaches.

✅ Best of both worlds.

❌ More complex to manage.

🔍 Example
Let’s say you have an e-commerce app:

Module A: User Login

Module B: Product Search

Module C: Shopping Cart

In Integration Testing:

You test how Module A passes the user info to Module B.

You check if adding items from B works correctly in C.

🧪 Tools Used
JUnit / TestNG (Java)

Pytest (Python)

Mocha / Chai (JavaScript)

Postman (for API integration)

SoapUI, RestAssured, etc.

🧠 Best Practices
Clearly define integration points.

Use mocks, stubs, and drivers smartly.

Start integration early and test incrementally.

Log every interaction and assertion clearly.
