useContext vs Redux
useContext: Built-in React hook to avoid prop drilling by sharing data across components.

Redux: External state management tool to handle complex global states across large applications.

✅ Use useContext for small to medium apps.
✅ Use Redux for scalable, predictable, and centralized state management.



Advantages of Redux Toolkit over Redux
Comes with pre-configured setup

Supports immer (for easy immutability)

Built-in DevTools integration

Reduces boilerplate with createSlice

Simplifies store setup with configureStore


 What is Dispatch?
dispatch() is used to send an action to the Redux store.

That action then triggers a reducer function to update the state.


dispatch(increment()); // example of dispatching an action

What is a Reducer?
A pure function that takes state and action, and returns a new updated state.

Reducers decide how the state should change.


(state, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
  }
}


What is a Slice?
A slice is a piece of the Redux store.

It contains:

name

initialState

reducers (actions and logic)

✅ Created using createSlice() from Redux Toolkit.
